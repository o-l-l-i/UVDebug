# UVDebugShader for Unity

![UV Debug shader](uv_test1.png)

This is one experiment I wanted to do - Write a procedural UV test texture, which would be a bit more resolution independent, without those nasty pixelation artifacts and so on. Needless to say it will eat a lot more GPU time than a texture.

Currently this is just a prototype and it's an unlit vert/frag shader.

It's written for Unity's built-in render pipeline.

I'd need to think about the details and balancing of many things, but this already has the things I usually need when I'm doing UV mapping.

## UI

I exposed some of the tweaks to the Inspector UI

It's possible to tweak it to get different looks:
